=============

Final Project for 6.344 (Digital Image Processing): Edge Detection.

To run, enter the following from the command line:

	python main.py [method] [optional: -alpha <n>] [images ...]

		[method] is either "-g" (gradient based) or "-l" (laplacian based)

		[images ...] is a space separated list of images to process

		[-alpha <n>], optional, lets you choose the scaling alpha value, see write up for more on this.
